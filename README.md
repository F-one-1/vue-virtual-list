## vue-virtual-list-observer

keyword: intersectionObserver scroll-list

## Advantages

* use intersectionObserver , faster 

* Only 3 required props, simple and very easy to use.

* Big data list with high render performance and efficient.

* Although you still need to pass in the height value of the prop to initialize the item, this is to handle edge cases and still support dynamic heights it will calculate automatic.

* Callback function, which allows the dynamic addition of list items according to the scrolling situation
